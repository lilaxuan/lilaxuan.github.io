○ What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS? How long did this overall assignment take you?
I think the most challenging piece of this assignment is to design the whole website. Since we have a lot of flexibilities on designing the website, so sometimes it might be wasting a lot of time changing the theme or the whole design if we didn't think about it throughly in the begining. And also, try to make the webpage adapative on different screen size and mobile friendly is another challening part of this project. Since we need to customize a lot of components so that it can work well on different screen sizes. It's not easy to work with HTML and CSS. We have to understand the underlying logic of most properities such as the box model, the flex model, and etc. The page is a whole integrated part, and randomly chaging things won't work. This assignment took me more than 12 hours. 

○ What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?


○ What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?
Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?


○ Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your
site in the future?
I will make the webpage look more professional, try to add theme, or integrate with Bootstrap frameworks. Add more responsive and dynamic design on the website. 

○ How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
It took me more than 12 hours to finish this assignment. Here are some main work that I spent most time on: Configuring the navbar which contains the links to each pages. Design each pages with distinct layout and styles. Make the webpage mobile friendly and adapative to different screen sizes.
